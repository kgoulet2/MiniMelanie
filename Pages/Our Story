<h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 80px;">ABOUT OUR TRUFFLES</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ever gazed longingly at a dessert menu and wished you could order everything on it from the chocolate cake, to the red velvet cupcake, to the cookies? We’ve built upon this whim and created mini desserts inside our chocolate truffles, neatly packed into a single box. Often called too pretty to eat, our mini confections are as delicious as they are lovely to look at. Many months perfecting how we’d transform our preservative-free and made by hand favorite cakes, candies, bars, and more into bite-sized treats gets us excited about celebrating your every occasion, decadent indulgence, and special gift. Even better, truffles ship nationwide and are available for custom orders! </p>

<h3>MELANIE MOSS</h3>
<p style="font-style: bold; font-size: 16px;"><strong>FOUNDER &amp; PASTRY CHEF</strong></p>
<p>Melanie grew up baking with her Viennese grandmother. The very first recipe they baked together is the same vanilla cake that we bake in the Mini Melanie kitchen today. Amidst a big family that spent their whole weekends cooking and thinking about what’s for dinner, Melanie found her calling in the cabinet housing rolling pins and cookie cutters. A hobby grew into an obsession and while attending Northwestern University, Melanie traveled to Paris and worked in her first professional kitchens. She went on to attend the Institute of Culinary Education and then honed her craft in the Michelin starred kitchens of Babbo and Blue Hill at Stone Barns, where she was Head Baker and Pastry Sous Chef.</p>
<p>Setting out on her own to start Mini Melanie took months of recipe testing and careful consideration, to bring you our “almost too pretty to eat” cake truffles and layer cakes. Just months after opening, Mini Melanie landed in the 2016 NYC Michelin guide and in 2018, Melanie competed and won a chocolate champion title on Food Network’s CHOPPED.</p>
<p>Mini Melanie has a team of seven employees and operates out of a custom-built commissary in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
